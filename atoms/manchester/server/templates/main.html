                    <p>Before lockdown, Spinningfields had a local economy catering for its office workers: restaurants, bars, pubs and health and beauty outlets were common in the area</p>

                    <p>During lockdown, almost all of the area's outlets closed as office workers were asked to work from home. A handful of banks and food shops remained open</p>

                    <p>But even with hospitality now able to open, many workers still haven’t returned to the office, leaving demand for Spinningfields’ restaurants and bars down. 
                    Footfall in Spinningfields is half that before lockdown. Overall, just 58% of its outlets had reopened as of 10 July, including 62% of restaurants</p>
