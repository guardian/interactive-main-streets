<p>St Ives relies heavily on a hospitality sector serving large numbers of tourists looking to enjoy the Cornish coast. Alongside these outlets, it also had a high number of shops selling books, arts and crafts, food and fashion before lockdown</p>

<p>But the reopening rate had recovered to 77% as of 14 July - lower than Sale and Ealing. While all food shops were open again, shops selling books, clothing and beauty services weren't doing so well.<br><br>
There are, however, hopes that the return of British tourists to the area can help boost the local economy again</p>
